# The Slaughter Relic

!!! quote "Echoes of Rage"
    It was not forged in fire, but in screams. Not tempered in steel, but in skulls. It will not rest until the galaxy kneels beneath it.

## The Slaughter Axe
Before setting up terrain, the players roll of. The winner of the roll off rolls one D6:

- On a 1–3, nothing happens.
- On a 4–6, set up a Blood Altar.

Place the Altar within 12" of the centre of the battlefield.

The Altar is treated as an objective marker for the purposes of control.
However, it does not generate any Victory Points through mission rules.

### Create a Blood Altar Tally.
Each time a player destroys an enemy unit, they add 1 point to their  :orange[Blood Altar Tally].
If a player reaches 8 or more Blood Altar Tally points, the Blood Altar is awakened.

## End of Battle
At the end of the battle, the player who controls the Blood Altar gains 2 Blackstone Fragments.

If that player has 8 or more Blood Altar Tally points, they also receive a Slaughter Relic.
