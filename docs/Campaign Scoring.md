# Campaign Scoring  

At the end of each campaign phase, each faction team earns Campaign Points based on how much territory they control on each planet.

## Scoring Rule  
For every 30% of a planet a team controls, they earn 1 Campaign Point.

30% control = 1 Campaign Point  
60% control = 2 Campaign Points  
90% or more = 3 Campaign Points

## Team Agendas  
Teams may also earn additional Campaign Points by completing Team Agendas assigned during each phase.

## Blackstone Supremacy  
At the end of each Campaign Phase, the team that possesses the highest number of Blackstone Fragments is awarded 3 additional Campaign Points.
