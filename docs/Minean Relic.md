# Minean Relic
!!! quote "Echoes of Bravery"
    The blade does not choose a hero.
    
    It chooses a purpose.

## The Blade of Minea  

Before setting up terrain, the players roll off. The winner of the roll off rolls one D6:  

- On a 1–3, place a **Damaged** Statue of Castor Minea.  
- On a 4–6, place an **Undamaged** Statue of Castor Minea.  

Place the statue within 12" of the centre of the battlefield.  

The statue is treated as an objective marker for the purposes of control.  
However, it does not generate any Victory Points through mission rules.

## End of Battle  
At the end of the battle, the player who controls the statue gains **2 Blackstone fragments**. That player also rolls one D6. On a 5+, they gain a **Minean Relic**.

!!! warning "Important"
    There are four Minean Relics. Once a Minean Relic has been discovered on a specific planet of the Aegis Line, no further Minean Relics can be discovered on that same planet for the remainder of the campaign.

    Minean Relics can be found on:
    
    - Bastion Thanovar
    - Vallak’s Spite, Gorgomire
    - Saint Alyssia’s Vigil.
