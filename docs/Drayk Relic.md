# Drayk Relic

!!! quote "Echoes of Determination"
    It was never the bullet that killed. It was the beam—the searing lance of heaven that followed the shot. Where the barrel turned, orbit burned.

## Fires from the Skies   
Before setting up terrain, the players roll off.

The winner of the roll off rolls one D6:  

- On a 1–3, nothing happens.  
- On a 4–6, place three Lucien Drayk statues.  

Place the statue within 12" of the centre of the battlefield.  

The statues are treated as objective markers for the purposes of control.  
However, they do not generate any Victory Points through mission rules.

## End of Battle  
At the end of the battle the player who controls more Lucien Drayk statues gains 2 Blackstone fragments. In addition, roll a D6. On a 4+ they gain a Drayk Relic.  

!!! warning "Important"
    There are **three** Drayk Relics. 
    
    Once a Drayk Relic has been discovered on a specific planet of the Aegis Line, no further Drayk Relics can be discovered on that same planet for the remainder of the campaign.  

    Drayk Relics can be found on: 
    
    - Pyran V
    - The Damorak Forge
    - Hekator
